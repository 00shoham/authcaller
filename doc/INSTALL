AuthCaller is designed to run on Linux systems.

It was built on Ubuntu and should work pretty much out of the box there.

You do need Apache installed first, with the cgi-bin module enabled.  

To build it, you will also have to download and compile idanlib:

  https://github.com/00shoham/idanlib

That has its own dependencies.

Once that has been downloaded and installed, you can build AuthCaller
and install it using the ./install.sh script in the src folder.
